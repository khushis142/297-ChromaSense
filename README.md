# Chrome-Extension-To-make-Websites-More-Accessible-for-Colourblind-and-Dyslexic-People
While the internet has become a comfortable and essential tool for most, there are groups who face notable challenges in using it. 

This is particularly true for people with disabilities, who are hindered by difficulties in accessing websites like dyslexic people, who encounter issues reading digital content due to distorted letters and words making comprehension difficult.

 Color blindness also poses challenges, complicating the interpretation of color-coded interfaces leading to misunderstandings and exclusion from data-driven conversations.

Our project's objective is to create an inclusive digital platform addressing these challenges.

Our solution empowers users by transforming website fonts into dyslexia-friendly ones and providing color correction options for different types of color blindness.
By integrating dyslexia-friendly fonts and color correction options, we aim to create a web that leaves no one behind.

Our solution provides three modes to aid color blindness â€“ adjusting background, text, and link colors for better readability:
